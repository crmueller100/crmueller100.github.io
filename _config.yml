  My name is Charles and I'm a professional Analytics Engineer. 
  I currently work at [Aclaimant](https://aclaimant.com/) where I specialize in developing data pipelines, streamlining ETL/ELT processes, and optimizing analytics workflows.
  I'm highly proficient in Python and SQL, with a strong foundation in software engineering principles and a passion for applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
  I recently completed my master's degree in computer science from Georgia Tech (December 2023), further enhancing my theoretical and practical understanding of machine learning and advanced programming concepts.

# Friendly and high-level

          This project offers a comprehensive suite of tools for chess game analysis. Built as a multi-container Docker application, it leverages Chess.com's public API and uses MongoDB and Stockfish to provide detailed insights into a player's performance.
          I used Airflow for job orchestration and facilitating automated data pulls and refreshes.
          The application allows users to explore their game history, analyze performance metrics, and identify areas for improvement. It features a user-friendly dashboard interface with filters for time control, color, date, and opening. 
          The integration with Stockfish offers in-depth game analysis, highlighting critical moves and errors.

          I analyzed Chicago's camera-based ticketing system using their [public data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/).
          It was a simple project that helped to keep my data analysis skills fresh, as well as uncover insights into citation patterns, particularly regarding ticket hotspots and temporal/seasonal variations.
          Its findings offer insights for residents to stay safe and save money.

          This was a quick project I made to settle an argument among my friends. "Horsies" is a luck-based board game that involves cards, dice, and probability. 
          After debating with them about which starting position has the highest chance of victory, I decided to simply brute force a solution. 
          Even when presented with my numerical analysis, many remain loyal to their gut instinct. I suppose that's gambling for you.

          Aclaimant was only 15 people when I joined. I was privileged to see it grow to more than double the size.
          As anyone who has worked in a startup can attest to, I take ownership over many responsibilities that expand beyond the scope of my job title.
          I frequently engage in data engineering, data analytics, business intelligence reviews, correspond and/or meet with our customers, and am always open as a point of contact to all other departments for ad hoc requests.

          Completing a master's degree in computer science while balancing a full-time job was no simple task, but I'm glad I did it. I took classes from various disciplines within the field of Computer Science, but my specialization was in Machine Learning.
          GA Tech's program was loaded with hands-on experience, reading technical literature, and learning about the theory and mathematics behind various Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning techniques.

          I couldn't be happier with my decision to pursue an undergraduate degree in Engineering Mechanics (referred to some as Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (TAM)). As an uncertain teenager trying to choose a career path, a major in Engineering Mechanics provided valuable exposure to a broad range of engineering sub-disciplines.
          The program's flexibility allowed me to focus on Computational Mechanics during my senior year, which sparked a passion for computational methods.
          This would eventually blossom into a devotion to the fields of data science and software engineering.
