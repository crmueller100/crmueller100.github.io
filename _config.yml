  My name is Charles and welcome to my website! I created this page as a place to share my professional journey, showcase some of my projects, and give folks an opportunity to connect.

  I'm currently an Analytics Engineer [Aclaimant](https://aclaimant.com/). Outside of my full-time job, I'm passionate about Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and learning about cloud-based infrastructure. I stay up-to-date with the market by subscribing to a multitude of newsletters and blogs, so let me know if you have anyone you think I should add to my feed!

  My strongest proficiencies are in <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, and <mark>Data Engineering</mark>.

  #         In a desperate attempt to get my dad and brother to stop paying the city of Chicago exorbitant fines in the form of red light camera tickets, I did some analysis using Chicago's [public data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/).

          Aclaimant was only 15 people when I joined. I was privileged to see it grow to more than double the size.
          As anyone who has worked in a startup can attest to, I take ownership over many responsibilities that expand beyond the scope of my job title.
          I frequently engage in data engineering, data analytics, business intelligence reviews, correspond and/or meet with our customers, and am always open as a point of contact to all other departments for ad hoc requests.

          Completing a Master's in Computer Science while balancing a full-time job was no simple task, but I'm glad I did it. I took classes from various disciplines within the field of Computer Science, but my specialization was in Machine Learning.
          GA Tech's program was loaded with hands-on experience, reading technical literature, and learning about the theory and mathematics behind various Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning techniques.

          I couldn't be happier with my decision to pursue am undergraduate degree in Engineering Mecahnics (referred to some as Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (TAM)). As an uncertain teenager trying to choose a career path, a major in Engineering Mechanics facilitated valuable exposure to a broad range of engineering sub-disciplines.
          The program's flexibility allowed me to focus on Computational Mechanics during my senior year, which sparked a passion for computational methods.
          This would eventually blossom into a devotion to the fields of data science and software engineering.
