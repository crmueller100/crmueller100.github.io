# Bio
My name is Charles Mueller and welcome to my website! I created this site as a location for people to view my projects and learn a little more about myself and my career interests. I am actively searching for a career in the field of Data Science and Analytics. This field intrigues me because it combines my love of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. There is virtually endless data in the world and it is fascinating to me how people are able to utilize it and discover trends they can use to better their business. My personal interest lies within machine learning and its various. 

# Projects
## Titanic
I began this project to actualize my skills in Python, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. This is the first project relating to Data Science I have done all by myself, so I am open to any critiques from more experienced data scientists. More information about this project can be found [here](https://github.com/crmueller100/Titanic).

## Clvehicle
This is a project that my college friend Jim enlisted my help for. He wanted someone to parse through, cleanse, and organize messy data. The end result would be a visualization of how the price of similar products differ in multiple geographic locations. Because the Titanic data set was very clean, I figured this would be an excellent chance to expose myself to data sets that are much messier. This project can be found [here](https://github.com/crmueller100/clvehicle).

# Background
## Education
I graduated in May 2015 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering Mechanics. My major included a secondary field of Computational Mechanics which involved discretizing PDEs into linear systems and developing numerical solutions with the help of Python, MATLAB, and Wolfram Mathematica. During my schoolwork, I also finished a minor in Computer Science. The classes I took for this minor were not based on computational science like my other classes. Instead, it focused on general programming concepts like Data Structures, sorting, OOP, Natural Language Processing, and Algorithms.
