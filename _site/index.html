      <p>My name is Charles and I’m a professional Analytics Engineer. 
I currently work at <a href="https://aclaimant.com/">Aclaimant</a> where I specialize in developing data pipelines, streamlining ETL/ELT processes, and optimizing analytics workflows.
I’m highly proficient in Python and SQL, with a strong foundation in software engineering principles and a passion for applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
I have experience working with AWS services for cloud-based data solutions, and am continuously expanding my expertise in cloud architecture as well as distributed computing principles.</p>

</p><p>This project offers a comprehensive suite of tools for chess game analysis. Built as a multi-container Docker application, it leverages Chess.com’s public API and uses MongoDB and Stockfish to provide detailed insights into a player’s performance.
I used Airflow for job orchestration and facilitating automated data pulls and refreshes.
It was deployed to AWS using ECR for container storage, ECS for container deployment, and DocumentDB for managed database services.
The application allows users to explore their game history, analyze performance metrics, and identify areas for improvement. It features a user-friendly dashboard interface with filters for time control, color, date, and opening. 
The integration with Stockfish offers in-depth game analysis, highlighting critical moves and errors.</p>

</p><p>My first foray into the world of Kaggle competitions was a great experience that ended with me placing in the top 10% of submissions and earning my first bronze medal!
It required a unique blend of my own creativity plus learning from an active community guided towards the same goal.
Combining my knowledge of machine learning and data analysis, the goal was to create a model that predicted the likelihood of problematic internet use in adolescents.
The model was based on a dataset provided by the Child Mind Institute, which contained survey responses from almost 4,000 adolescents.</p>

</p><p>I analyzed Chicago’s camera-based ticketing system using their <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/">public data portal</a>.
It was a simple project that helped to keep my data analysis skills fresh, as well as uncover insights into citation patterns, particularly regarding ticket hotspots and temporal/seasonal variations.
Its findings offer insights for residents to stay safe and save money.</p>

</p><p>This was a quick project I made to settle an argument among my friends. “Horsies” is a luck-based board game that involves cards, dice, and probability. 
After debating with them about which starting position has the highest chance of victory, I decided to simply brute force a solution. 
Even when presented with my numerical analysis, many remain loyal to their gut instinct. I suppose that’s gambling for you.</p>

</p><p>Completing a master’s degree in computer science while balancing a full-time job was no simple task, but I’m glad I did it. I took classes from various disciplines within the field of Computer Science, but my specialization was in Machine Learning.
GA Tech’s program was loaded with hands-on experience, reading technical literature, and learning about the theory and mathematics behind various Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning techniques.</p>

</p><p>I couldn’t be happier with my decision to pursue an undergraduate degree in Engineering Mechanics (referred to some as Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (TAM)). As an uncertain teenager trying to choose a career path, a major in Engineering Mechanics provided valuable exposure to a broad range of engineering sub-disciplines.
The program’s flexibility allowed me to focus on Computational Mechanics during my senior year, which sparked a passion for computational methods.
This would eventually blossom into a devotion to the fields of data science and software engineering.</p>
